Features
--------

* GOLF provides a lightweight solution to support the implementation of FL.
* GOLF modularizes system functions to achieve loose coupling during system development and deployment, which makes the framework more generic and scalable.
* GOLF uses container technology to ensure that the system is weakly dependent on the compilation environment to achieve portability.
* GOLF is compatible with multiple devices (e.g., Android, embedded computers, edge devices, etc.).

#. ðŸŒŸ **June 07, 2024** - Introducing Cedar:

  Cedar is a secure, cost-efficient, and domain-adaptive framework for federated meta-learning. Key features include:

  - ðŸ’¡ **Federated Meta-Learning**: Enable a safeguarded knowledge transfer with high model generalizability and adaptability.
  - ðŸ“¨ **Cost-Efficient**: Implement a layer-wise model uploading mechanism to reduce communication cost.
  - ðŸ”’ **Robust Security**: Defend against malicious attacks like data inversion and model poisoning.
  - ðŸ”§ **High Performance**: Support high-performance personalization and customization of globally shareable meta-models.

Installation
-------------

To install GOLF, simply use pip:

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install golf_federated

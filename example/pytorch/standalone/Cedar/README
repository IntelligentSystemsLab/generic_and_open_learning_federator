# Example for Cedar

## Overview
This is a test example designed for Cedar. The test data required for execution is available in the main directory under:
```
/example/data/non_iid_data/
```
This example allows users to experiment with federated learning and customize various settings.

## System Requirements
- **Hardware:**
  - No specialized or non-standard hardware is required.
  - If your system has insufficient memory to run the project, consider adjusting the `batchsize` or switching to smaller datasets.

- **GPU/CPU Options:**
  - If you do not have access to a GPU, the program can be run in CPU mode by modifying the settings.

## Expected Output
- **Accuracy:**
  - Due to variations in random seeds and device-specific behavior, the expected accuracy after running the example is approximately **58%**.

---

## Expected Run Time
- **Setup:**
  - The expected runtime was tested on a personal computer with the following specifications:
    - **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 5800X
    - **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060

- **Runtime Details:**
  - Completing the entire pipeline, which includes 100 rounds of training across all clients and 20 rounds of deployment, takes approximately **4.5 hours**.

## Notes
- Feel free to modify the provided configurations to suit your setup.
- Ensure that the data path is correctly set to `/example/data/non_iid_data/` for seamless execution.
